# MEDS-DEV Supported Tasks

In these subdirectories, we store the task configuration files (see [this
tool](https://github.com/justin13601/ESGPTTaskQuerying/) for the task configuration language) that are used in
MEDS-DEV.

The format here is `dataset_name/task_name.yaml` where `dataset_name` is the name of the dataset and
`task_name` is the name of the task. tasks can be nested, realized as simply including "`/`"s in their names.
