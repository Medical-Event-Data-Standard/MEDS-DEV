description: >-
  This file specifies the base configuration for the extraction and analysis of "diseases of the
  skin and subcutaneous tissue" based on ICD codes in patients admitted to the hospital.
  This task predicts whether the relevant ICD codes will be assigned to a patient at the time of
  the hospital discharge, leveraging only the data from the first 24 hours of their admission to
  the hospital. Only patients whose hospital stay is at least 24 hours will be included.
  This task uses mapping definitions from ICD9CM codes to Clinical Classifications Software (CCS)
  Level 1 labels using tools for multi-level CCS diagnosis categories
  (https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs/Multi_Level_CCS_2015.zip). For ICD10CM codes, we
  first mapped them to ICD9CM codes using General Equivalence Mappings (GEMS)
  (https://data.nber.org/gem/icd10cmtoicd9gem.csv), and again mapped the converted codes to the
  corresponding CCS Level 1 labels. For the specific ICD9CM or ICD10CM codes for this task, see
  the predicates field below.
